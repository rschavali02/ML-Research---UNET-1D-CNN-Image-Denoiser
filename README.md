# ML-Research---UNET-1D-CNN-Image-Denoiser

This paper explores the modification of the UNet architecture into a 1-dimensional denoiser for signal noise reduction on hyperspectral imaging. A variety of noise levels are considered, and the effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through quantitative metrics and visualizations.

The model was trained on the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, all work was done alongside the Computational Imaging Group @ WashU
